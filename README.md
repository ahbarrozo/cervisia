# Cervisia: a beer-lover's web app

Cervisia is a personal project aiming at connecting people willing to share their love for nice beers. Find breweries near you, share your thoughts about them, and suggest new breweries.

And remember: drink responsibly :)

## Development

Cervisia is being developed using React, with NextJS for routing and API handling. We use Open Brewery DB (https://www.openbrewerydb.org/) as our initial database, integrating to the app using MongoDB. We hope to have an app that would allow to contribute to the official database as users insert new breweries.
